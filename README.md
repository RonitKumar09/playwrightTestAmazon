# Amazon E-commerce Automation Framework

A clean, modular TypeScript-based Playwright automation framework for Amazon e-commerce testing.

## 🎯 Features

- **Product Search Validation**: Verifies expected keywords in search results
- **Smart Cart Management**: Adds products based on price ranges with different strategies
- **Price Validation**: Ensures cart totals match individual product prices
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with TypeScript

## 📋 Test Scenarios

For each product (wireless mouse, Bluetooth headset, data cable, pen drive, laptop stand):

1. **Search & Validate**: Search product and verify expected keywords appear
2. **Price-based Actions**:
   - ₹500-₹1000: Add directly to cart
   - Below ₹500: Navigate to product page, set quantity to 2, then add to cart
   - Above ₹1000: Skip
3. **Cart Validation**: Verify products, prices, and total calculations
